## üìå Introduction

**üòäBackground**: Drug‚Äìtarget binding affinity (DTA) identification is significant for early-stage drug discovery. Although some methods have been proposed, there are still some limitationsüé∂. Firstly, sequence-based methods directly extract sequence features from fixed-length protein sequences, which requires truncating or padding the sequences and leads to either information loss or the introduction of noise. Secondly, structure-based methods focus on extracting topological information but have limitations in capturing sequence features. 

**üíïResults**: Therefore, a novel deep learning-based method is proposed named GraphkmerDTA that integrates Kmer features with structural topology. üöÄ Specifically, GraphkmerDTA uses graph neural networks to extract topological features from molecules and proteins and fully connected networks to learn local sequence patterns from Kmer features of proteins. üìä Experimental results show that GraphkmerDTA outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets. Additionally, a case study on lung cancer is conducted, and GraphkmerDTA identifies seven known EGFR inhibitors from a screening library of over two thousand compounds. üí° To further validate the practicality of GraphkmerDTA, our model is integrated with network pharmacology to explore the mechanisms of the Lonicera japonica flower in treating Alzheimer's disease. üß† Through this interdisciplinary approach, three potential molecules are identified and finally validated by molecular docking. üî¨ In conclusion, we not only propose a novel AI model for the DTA task but also demonstrate its practical application value in drug discovery by integrating it with traditional drug discovery methods. üåü

## üîó Datasets

This project uses the following three datasets: Davis, Human, and KIBA. Follow the steps below to obtain and preprocess the datasets.

### Step 1: Obtain Datasets

Obtain the Davis, Human, and KIBA datasets from public resources.

### Step 2: Ligand Preprocessing

- Use SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) to represent ligands.
- Ensure all ligands are standardized in their SMILES representation to improve model compatibility and accuracy.

### Step 3: Protein Structure Prediction

- Use the `Pconsc4` tool to predict the secondary structure of proteins.
- For each protein sequence, `Pconsc4` will generate structural features used for subsequent GNN modeling.

### Step 4: Dataset Splitting

Split the dataset according to different use cases:

- **Davis and KIBA Datasets**:
  - Use two splitting modes:
    1. Training + Testing
    2. Training + Validation + Testing (5-fold cross-validation)

- **Human Dataset**:
  - Use Training + Validation + Testing split mode.

## üçæ Application1: deep learning-based drug discovery
This application provides a powerful, deep learning-based virtual screening tool for drug repurposing. It uses the **GraphkmerDTA** model to predict potential interactions between drugs and target proteins, enabling researchers to identify new uses for existing drugs efficiently.

The `screen.py` script allows users to quickly perform virtual screening by leveraging pre-trained models and exploring potential drug-target interactions. The results are saved for further exploration and analysis.

- **Easy to Use**: No need for deep technical knowledge‚Äîjust set up your inputs and let the model do the work.
- **Fast Results**: Utilizing parallel processing and GPU support, the virtual screening process is significantly faster than traditional methods.
- **Repurposing Opportunities**: Discover new potential therapeutic uses for existing drugs, accelerating the drug discovery process.

To get started with the virtual screening tool, simply run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python screen.py <traindata_index> <dataset_name> <cuda_index> <version> [--drug_library_path <path>] [--target_library_path <path>] [--output_path <path>] [--num_workers <num_workers>]
```

Basic Steps

1. **Select Dataset**: Choose the dataset (`davis` or `kiba`) to use for drug-target interaction predictions.
2. **Specify CUDA Device**: If available, select a GPU to speed up computation.
3. **Set Paths**: Customize paths for drug libraries, target libraries, and output files as needed.
4. **Run Screening**: Execute the script to perform virtual screening. The results will be saved automatically in Excel format for each target.

Example:
```bash
python screen.py 0 davis 0 v1
```
This command will run the virtual screening using the **davis** dataset, using GPU `cuda:0`, with version identifier `v1`. The results will be saved in the specified output directory as Excel files, with each file corresponding to a screened target. These results provide valuable insights into possible drug-target interactions.
